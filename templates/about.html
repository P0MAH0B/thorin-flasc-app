        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
        in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
        Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
        Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
        action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned
        to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in
                his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug,
                in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle
                of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's
                East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on
                the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.[2]

                Thorin became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk in TA 2850, after his father went missing and died in the
                dungeons of Dol Guldur.

            <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also
                nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing
                feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.[2]

                As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching.
                It was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.[3]

                With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking
                Thranduil.[4] They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they
                reached Lake-town.[5] The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by
                the river.[6]

                At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Balin
                and Bilbo. Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading into the mountain.[7]

                Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of Five
                Armies, and all three were later buried with honor.[8]

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's
                company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves
                who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin
                were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the
                group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain
                with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.

                Lonely Mountain in the Quest of Erebor. He was also the father of Gimli, who became a member of the
                Fellowship of the Ring.

                Glóin chiefly appears in The Hobbit as a supporting character. Glóin also appears in The Fellowship of
                the Ring during the Council of Elrond.

            <p>
                Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen
                Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
                A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest
                friends and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin.

                He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in Moria, but within five years it was overcome once
                more by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

            Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

            Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the
            forks"; as well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his
            grumbling”. He often wore a red-violet coat while on the Quest of Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be the
            strongest of the thirteen companions.[2]

                and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced
                to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a
                new life at his halls in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.
