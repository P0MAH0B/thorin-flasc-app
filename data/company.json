        "name": "Thorin Oakenshield",
        "description": "Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thr√°in II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet 'Oakenshield'  which remained with him even in death.[2] Thorin became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk in TA 2850, after his father went missing and died in the dungeons of Dol Guldur." ,
